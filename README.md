# pyoAddSynth
Additive Synth using Juce and Pyo


Audio Units build and work well in some hosts. VST plugins will build, but will not load into any host. I am a novice C++ programmer which probably explains the known issues.

You must have Pyo installed to run the plug-in. http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/

This plug-in is based on:

Olivier BÃ©langer's Pyo embedded tutorial.
